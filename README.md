<!--
Your README.md file should be minimally multiple paragraphs in length, and should provide a comprehensive documentation of what you did and, if applicable, why you did it.

It documents your project thoroughly, and that distinguishes this project from others in the course and defends its complexity.

This section alone should consist of several paragraphs, before you even begin to talk about the documentation of your project.

### Distinctiveness and Complexity
<!-- Why you believe your project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements, mentioned above. -->
#### Goal Tracker
- Your timeline to your goals.

#### The Why
The developer of this project struggled with reaching his goals. He was inconsistent with them. For this reason, he decided to create an app that would help him improve. That app is Goal Tracker. 


#### Quick Overview
The app is fairly easy to use. 
It has three main components: 
- Big Goal
- Daily Action
- Timeline

A Big Goal can be any goal the user considers as BIG in that he really wants or needs to make it happen.

A Daily Action is anything that the user needs to do DAILY to reach his Big Goal.

A timeline is needed here to help the user visualize where he currently is. 


#### How to start
The user must begin by creating his personal account using the "Create an account" Form. The user is required to input data into four fields in the form: "username", "email", "password", and "confirm password".

After creating an account, the user will be directed instantly to the Home page. There, the user may now create his first "Big Goal" by clicking the "Add a Big Goal" button. The user is required to input a Title, a Start date, and a Deadline date (a Description is optional). 

After a successfully creating a Big Goal, the user will automatically notice a "Big Goal" box on the Home page containing key details about his newly created Big Goal. 

Upon clicking on the "Big Goal" box, the user will automatically be directed to the "Big Goal" page. There, the user may now view the Timeline starting from the Start date and ending with the Deadline date. The user may now also create Daily Actions by clicking the "Add a Daily Action" button. And if the user desires to delete the "Big Goal", the "Delete Big Goal" is included in the "Big Goal" page.

#### The Home page
The Home page consists of three sections: the header, the big goal section, and the "tasks today"

#### The "Big Goal" page
The "Big Goal" page consists of ...

#### Login/Register page

#### Focus
This project focuses on the consistency of showing up daily to check those goals. Thus, he decided to create his own app in this project. 

He visualized that the any user wants to have a timeline - a timeline that is based on the Start Date and End Date of the Goal created by the user himself.  and that is what Goal Tracker does.
